## CVM

Count the number of distinct items in a stream using fixed sized memory. The CVM algorithm works by using randomization to estimate the number of unique entries in a list, by keeping a small number of entries in memory and using probability to decide whether to keep or discard new entries. We can get a good estimate of distinct items with a small error margin.
